*Mapping the University* is a collaborative archival research project that examines the planning, construction, and expansion of two public university campuses in Virginia: George Mason University and Old Dominion University. With an emphasis on training students in archival methods and digital skills, the project is a collaboration between undergraduate and graduate students, archivists, historians, geographers, and digital scholars across two institutions. Using aerial photographs, interactive maps, and digitized archival materials, *Mapping the University* explores the construction of these two twentieth-century campuses to address the following question: what can the built environment of a college campus tell us about the changing social landscape of the university and its role in reshaping the surrounding areas?

This project was created at the [Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media (RRCHNM)](https://rrchnm.org/) at George Mason University in partnership with the [University Archives at Old Dominion University](https://www.odu.edu/library/special-collections). The project is supported by a [4-VA Collaborative Research Grant](https://4va.gmu.edu/grants/).
