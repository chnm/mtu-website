title: Narratives
---

The essays below narrate the history of places, people, events, and movements on the campuses of George Mason University and Old Dominion University. These narratives explore campus history stories using multimedia source material, including digitized archival material, historical images, and audio clips of oral history interviews. One of our project's goals was to put archival sources in conversation with digital interactive maps. To that end, alongside the narration and sources, each essay includes an interactive map that allows the reader to visualize the spatial dimensions of the story.
