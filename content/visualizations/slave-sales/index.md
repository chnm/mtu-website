In the fall of 1968, an article in the *Gunston Ledger*, a student newspaper at George Mason College, began: “If you saw some weird-looking people wandering around last Friday, don’t worry that you’re losing your mind, because…[it] was Slave Day.” Just a few years earlier, in 1965, a similar article from Old Dominion College’s student newspaper began: “Slavery returned to ODC Dec. 7 in the form of the ODC Young Democratic Club’s Second Annual Slave Sale.” What were these campus events at GMC and ODC, and what were their larger meanings? Comparing instances of mock “slave sales” at both colleges from the 1960s and early 1970s shows these past events were highly visible, condoned by faculty, and regularly occurred at other institutions throughout Virginia and the United States. Mock campus “slave sales” were just one example of larger cultures of racial ridicule at Mason and elsewhere, as demonstrated in recent research by the [Center for Mason Legacies’ Black Lives Next Door project](https://silverbox.gmu.edu/legacy/s/blnd/page/racial-ridicule-at-george-mason). Mock “slave sales” exhibit how white Americans promoted cultural and racial dominance over, and at the expense of, African Americans throughout the United States.

*What were these events?* On both campuses, students hosted mock “slave sales” as public fundraising events for different student groups and fraternities. The event involved students offering payments for other students to do whatever they wished for a day. At ODC, most of these events were fundraisers for the Young Democrats Club, while at GMC, one event fundraised for a school dance in 1963 and another covered a student’s hospital expenses in 1971.

*Who participated in them?* Female students were mostly “auctioned off” to male students. Auctioneers described women at ODC as “capable of typing, cleaning, baby sitting, and conversation.” Some women were even taken out on dates. The frontpage of GMC’s *Broadside* in 1971 pictured a woman standing proudly holding a sign that read: “please buy me.” 

{{< figure id="img4" image="Broadside-Nov-1971-crop.png" caption="Figure 4. An advertisement for Mason’s TKE fraternity’s “slave auction” featuring a woman proudly holding a sign that reads “please buy me.” *Broadside*, November 10, 1971." >}}

It was offensive for white women to be jokingly “bought” for dates and domestic labor, but the racial implications of these events were far more troubling and dehumanizing for African Americans in each campus community. Faculty also participated in and supported the mock “slave sales” on both campuses. In 1965, a faculty member at ODC “bought” a student, and a few male faculty members agreed to be auctioned off at GMC. One of these faculty members was James Shea, a professor popular with students but unpopular with the administration due to his anti-Vietnam stances. Faculty and staff condoned mock “slave sale” events financially and culturally by participating in offensive re-enactments.

*Where did these events occur on campus?* The mock “slave sales” occurred in public spaces on both campuses, most likely to increase visibility and participation. GMC’s events were most likely hosted outside the main quad and inside the <span class="notation" data-id="1" data-zoom="18" data-lat="38.832452" data-lon="-77.308546">basement of the South Building</span>. Students gathered in this area before the SUB One student center was built, and it was a highly trafficked and used space on campus.

<span class="notation" data-id="1" data-zoom="16" data-lat="36.885341" data-lon="-76.307101">“Slave sales” occured in similar places at ODC</span>, also in highly trafficked areas in the center of campus. As at Mason, these events at ODC took place in a central, visible space predominantly used by students outside of the <span class="notation" data-id="1" data-zoom="18" data-lat="36.889746" data-lon="-76.304750">Administration building</span>. One student reported that they spontaneously participated because they walked out of the student center. These shared campus spaces at both colleges were later used for other activities like political organizing. They were highly visible sites of student life, learning, and racial ridicule, which suggests how visible racial ridicule was on campuses during this time.

*Were “slave sales” unique to these colleges?* “Slave sale” fundraisers occured at other institutions <span class="notation" data-id="1" data-zoom="8" data-lat="37.580297" data-lon="-78.429573">throughout Virginia</span> and the United States. For example, “slave auctions” were organized as early as 1961 at Fairfax’s Lee High School and Scottsville High in Scottsville, Virginia.[^1]

Some Virginia colleges such as Clinch Valley College in Wise, Virginia, organized similar events as late as 1984.[^2]

Even churches in Virginia participated: St. Patrick’s Episcopal Church in Falls Church advertised a “slave auction” in 1970.[^3]

[^3]: *Northern Virginia Sun*, April 25, 1970.

Newspaper articles typically mention faculty support or adult supervision, indicating that these fundraisers often enjoyed institutional support and adult leadership. Mock “slave sales” at GMC and ODC were far from unique; they were part of a larger phenomenon of racial ridicule in Virginia and beyond.

*Why and how were mock “slave sales” offensive?* In a forthcoming book titled *The Souls of White Jokes*, sociologist [Raúl Pérez](https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=30308) argues that white Americans have historically used humor as a way to racially exclude and ridicule African Americans and people of color from society.[^4]

Campus “slave sales” were key examples of such racial ridicule. They recreated the degradation and trauma of antebellum slave auctions with an air of mockery: student auctioneers called people “slaves” and “masters” at these events, and participants dressed up with props such as banjos and sheets over their heads.

Historically, “slave auctions” sold enslaved people to white enslavers, which immorally and inhumanely placed economic values on enslaved human beings.[^5]

The historical “auction block” was a site of trauma, pain, and family separation for enslaved people.[^6]

No doubt white college students joking about this painful history was deeply troubling and psychologically harmful to African Americans. Printed on the very same frontpage of the *Broadside* that featured an advertisement for a TKE fundraiser with a female student holding a sign that read “please buy me,” was an article about the Mason student “Anarchist Club” calling for legal action to stop campus “slave sales.” Though the fundraisers were common throughout campus, not every student condoned them–some recognized they were offensive and even tried to stop them.

{{< figure id="img9" image="Broadside-Nov-1971-full.png" caption="Figure 9. An article about the Mason student “Anarchist Club” protesting TKE’s “slave sale” fundraiser was printed on the same frontpage advertising for the very same TKE fundraiser picturing a female student holding a sign that read “please buy me.” Note the offensive article on the same page “Wife Sought for Indian Student” that [Black Lives Next Door](https://silverbox.gmu.edu/legacy/s/blnd/page/racial-ridicule-at-george-mason) discusses as another instance of racial ridicule on campus. Broadside, November 10, 1971." >}}

*What were other examples of racial ridicule on campus?* [As research from the Black Lives Next Door project has shown](https://silverbox.gmu.edu/legacy/s/blnd/page/racial-ridicule-at-george-mason), “slave sales” were just one example among other acts of racial ridicule on GMC’s campus, including the use of blackface. Blackface originated on the minstrel stage in the 1890s in the U.S., where white people painted their faces black and performed comedic routines about African Americans. In the 1960s, Mason students also mocked an African American neighbor of the university, Andy Smith, who was forcefully pushed off of campus later by administration. These are both instances of racial ridicule outside of “slave sales” on Mason’s campus.

*How does this relate more largely to racism on campus?* Racial ridicule on campuses occurred within a wider context of racial exclusion institutionally on these campuses. Faculty were involved in “slave auctions” at both GMC and ODC, which points to the troubling way professors also participated and condoned racial ridicule on campus. At Mason in the 1960s and 1970s, students and faculty were predominantly white,[^7]

[^7]: *The Washington Post*, May 9, 1970.

and the college faced legal challenges for not complying with the 1964 Civil Rights Act, as seen in the [1971 Civil Rights Report](https://silverbox.gmu.edu/legacy/s/blnd/page/thefinalfour) conducted by United States Commission on Civil Rights Virginia State Advisory Committee. The issue of racism at both colleges was bigger than the students that organized them.

*What do these events mean for us today?* As the first English colony established in 1607, Virginia has a long history of slavery.[^8]

[^8]: Philip D. Morgan, *Slave Counterpoint: Black Culture in the Eighteenth-Century Chesapeake and Lowcountry* (University of North Carolina Press, 1985). 

Its legacies continue in material ways today, specifically through racial inequity. For example, recent projects of George Mason’s [Black Lives Next Door](https://silverbox.gmu.edu/legacy/s/blnd/page/home) and Old Dominion’s [Mapping Lambert’s Point](https://www.mappinglambertspoint.org/) describe racial consequences of campus construction such as displacement. Culturally, Virginia’s legacies of slavery also continue to reverberate today, specifically through white supremacy and racial ridicule. In 2019, Governor of Virginia Ralph Northam faced public criticism over a photo of him in blackface from the 1980s.[^9]

The history of less subtle forms of racial ridicule such as mock “slave sales” are also important to study today. College events such as “slave sales” had both cultural and material significance to campuses, and remind us that racial ridicule remains a troubling issue today.
