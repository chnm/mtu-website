The J.C., or <span class="notation" data-id="1" data-zoom="16" data-lat="38.82993999457891" data-lon="-77.30735924375185">Johnson Center,</span> is currently the central part of the George Mason campus.  It is a space for students to study, grab food, hang out, promote activities, host meetings, and it houses various administrative offices. But the J.C. was not always the center of student life on campus. For a long period during the 1970s and 80s, the <span class="notation" data-id="1" data-zoom="16" data-lat="38.83163281044512" data-lon="-77.30893228240448">SUB 1 building</span> was the center of student activities and attracted commuter students to stay on campus longer than just for class.

Picture sitting in a small basement with limited seating and presumably a small area to grab food. This was all that was provided for students at the beginning of Mason’s history on the Fairfax campus. Even with this significant upgrade to the basement of the South Building, time went on and the admissions doubled, causing major space issues. In the 1970s the Chancellor described the hazards of this enclosed space. The space became so crowded and overrun that it was a breeding ground for germs and maintenance issues. [^1]

SUB 1 was a building designed very early in Mason’s history; it was first suggested in 1967. The actual construction was delayed for around seven years due to money and other construction the administration deemed a priority. When first requested on January 30, 1967 for a Capital Outlay request, SUB 1 was the third priority for the 1968-1970 agenda.[^2] It was not until the August request, that the building became the first priority in the 1970-72 Capital Outlay project.[^3] This suggests that the administration predicted the growth, but knew they could hold off on construction for a while. Evidence also indicates that for this building to be constructed per the request of the students it was going to have to be paid for partially by the students.[^4] In this case it would be a 60 dollar fee per student in addition to other administrative and school costs, which would be placed into bonds to accumulate interest. The goal was to reduce it to 45 dollars, as Chancellor Thompson suggested that the fee would be too much for the students in addition to the tuition, other student fees, and books for their courses. But they needed a building, and even a cheap small one would be better than nothing. As time went on it became clear: a larger and more permanent student center building would be needed as the student population grew.

One of the first discussions of student housing occurred on May 24, 1973 in a letter referencing a Board of Visitors meeting.[^1]
