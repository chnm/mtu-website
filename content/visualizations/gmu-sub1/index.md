The J.C., or <span class="notation" data-id="1" data-zoom="16" data-lat="38.82993999457891" data-lon="-77.30735924375185">Johnson Center,</span> is currently the central part of the George Mason campus.  It is a space for students to study, grab food, hang out, promote activities, host meetings, and it houses various administrative offices. But the J.C. was not always the center of student life on campus. For a long period during the 1970s and 80s, the SUB 1 building was the center of student activities and attracted commuter students to stay on campus longer than just for class.

Picture sitting in a small basement with limited seating and presumably a small area to grab food. This was all that was provided for students at the beginning of Mason’s history on the Fairfax campus. Granted, this was an upgrade compared to what pre Mason campus students had when they studied at an old high school building at Bailey’s Crossroads, which only had space next to the local firehouse to congregate. Even with this significant upgrade to the basement of the South Building, time went on and the admissions doubled, causing major space issues. In the 1970s the Chancellor described the hazards of this enclosed space. The space became so crowded and overrun that it was a breeding ground for germs and maintenance issues.

One of the first discussions of student housing occurred on May 24, 1973 in a letter referencing a Board of Visitors meeting.[^1]
