Like some institutions of higher education across the Commonwealth of Virginia during the Great Depression, there were not a lot of female faculty and staff at the <span class="notation" data-id="1" data-zoom="15" data-lat="36.889865" data-lon="-76.304134">Norfolk Division of William & Mary.</span> The first academic year the division opened, 1930 to 1931, there were only four female instructors who taught in the fields of English, history, mathematics and physics, and physical education. During World War II, the Norfolk Division provided free war training classes to women in areas such as aircraft repair and drafting, which offered female students the opportunity to learn these skills, in many cases for the first time.[^1]  By 1967, as more women entered the workforce in the postwar period, some for the first time, there were approximately 184 female faculty and staff at Old Dominion. That same year, the <span class="notation" data-id="1" data-zoom="17" data-lat="36.885124" data-lon="-76.303050">Lions Club Child Study Center</span> opened at the corner of 45th Street and Hampton Boulevard. Built with contributions largely from the local Kiwanis and Lions Club organizations, the Child Study Center was initially designed to contain a speech and hearing clinic for local children, an instruction center for teachers of the visually handicapped, as well as a training center for future teachers in early childhood education. Most of the users of these services were from the community, and they did not provide day care for Old Dominion employees.

The passage of Title IX of the Education Amendments Act in 1972 sparked more discussion of equal rights for female faculty and staff on academic campuses, and in particular, the need to provide child care services for faculty and staff on campus. Fed up with the difference in salaries between male and female faculty at ODU, Dr. Carolyn Rhodes and Dr. Dorothy Johnson helped establish the Faculty Women’s Caucus in 1974 to advance the interests and rights of women on campus. It was around this time that the caucus first started to advocate for a day care center on campus for ODU employees.[^2]

In 1975, the Board of Visitors passed a new sick and maternity leave policy, which allowed employees to take additional leave from work after delivery if certified by the attending physician. The following year, Old Dominion opened the Women’s Center, which provided educational, personal, and vocational counseling; non-credit courses, and discussion groups. At the start, most of those that took advantage of the Women’s Center’s resources were those experiencing a transition in their life, such as returning to the job market or school after having a child. By 1977, the Child Study Center, under the direction of the Darden School of Education, started to provide pre-kindergarten nursery classes taught by professional instructors, student teachers, and teaching assistants, but it wasn’t until the 1980s that day care for Old Dominion employees started to take shape.

In the 1980s, as many colleges and universities were already providing child care for their employees, the Women’s Caucus decided to make a stand. In the absence of a child care center on campus, the Women’s Center had long provided listings of local day care facilities for students and employees. In 1988, the Women’s Caucus set up a day care committee to initiate a survey to a random sample of university employees on whether or not they were in favor of Old Dominion creating an on-site day care center. 

{{< figure id="image3" image="WomensCaucusSurvey-ChildCare-1988001.jpg" caption="Figure 3. Page from Women's Caucus Survey on Need for Day Care at ODU, 1988" >}}

The results were overwhelmingly in favor of having a day care center on or near campus, with 96% of women and 85% of men supporting the proposal. In addition, most of the respondents indicated they wanted day care five days a week, and would like to have either just afternoon care or the entire work day. In light of these results, Old Dominion created a campus-wide ad hoc day care task force the following year to investigate the feasibility of having a day care center on-site.[^3] Finally, in 1993, after almost 20 years of discussion and deliberation, the <span class="notation" data-id="1" data-zoom="17" data-lat="36.886887" data-lon="-76.311376">Child Care Center</span> was approved and opened in August of 1994 in the old Career Development Services building off 48th Street.

The Child Care Center opened under the direction of Katharine Kersey, Chair of the Department of Early Childhood, Speech-Language Pathology and Special Education, and coordinator Jody Wolford. It was open five days a week with a maximum capacity for 65 children from 6 weeks to 5 years old, and it contained classrooms, observation areas for parents to view their children, and a common area for group activities.  Day care was offered between 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday during the academic year, and for eight weeks during the summer.

The cost of renovating the center and start-up funds were allocated by ODU, but as there were no operating funds from the Commonwealth of Virginia, the center was self-supporting, getting most of their operating expenses from the child’s enrollment fees. At the time of the center’s opening, tuition of $100/week per child and a sliding scale based on salary were discussed. Although originally intended for ODU faculty and staff, day care services were eventually offered to student mothers and the surrounding community. By the late 1990s, the center was renamed the Child Development Center, and by the late 2000s, the center was growing so rapidly that they needed extra space. By 2016, day care moved into the recently renovated Lions Club Child Study Center, and the old Child Development Center building was eventually demolished to make room for the Hugo A. Owens House. As of 2021, child care for infants and toddlers takes place in the Children’s Learning and Research Center off 47th Street, while preschool classes are taught in the Lions Club Child Study Center.





The football team played at <span class="notation" data-id="1" data-zoom="17" data-lat="36.866165" data-lon="-76.281292">Bain Field</span> on East 20th Street near Church Street; the men’s basketball team held their games at James Blair Middle School and Maury High School; and the baseball team’s home games were played at Lafayette Park on Granby Street, Bain Field, and the open field just south of the old Larchmont School. Most of the opponents the Norfolk Division played during the 1930s and 1940s were high schools, professional schools, and junior colleges throughout the state. Although not varsity sports, the Norfolk Division established a women’s basketball team in 1930, and in 1936, developed several additional intramural sports for women including badminton, swimming, field hockey, and tennis. With the expansion of enrollment, as well as the development of several athletic programs, the Norfolk Division sought funding to develop a new classroom/gymnasium building as well as an athletic stadium. Between 1934 and 1936, the division received funds from the newly established Public Works Administration (PWA) and Works Progress Administration (WPA) for the two facilities.[^1] 



The first structure, built at an estimated $123,000 and dubbed simply the <span class="notation" data-id="1" data-zoom="19" data-lat="36.890011" data-lon="-76.304579">Administration Building,</span> opened to over 400 students in 1936 and housed administrative offices, eight lecture halls, a library, two gymnasiums, and a swimming pool.[^2] Located across Bolling Avenue from the old Larchmont School, the basketball and swimming teams moved their events to the Administration Building along with other intramural sports.

Physical education classes also took place in the gymnasium along with special events such as concerts, Commencement exercises, student versus faculty basketball games, and competition among early Greek organizations. The athletics program grew significantly through the 1950s and 1960s, especially with the inclusion of women’s varsity teams for basketball, field hockey, and swimming, and the men’s basketball team moved their games to the larger Norfolk Arena. Donna Doyle, one of the best athletes of the 1950s, would have her name attached to the first athletic scholarships for women in 1975. Leo Anthony, star of the 1957-1961 men’s basketball team, was Old Dominion’s first basketball All-American with 2,181 points.[^3]

The men’s basketball team stopped playing in the gymnasium in 1960 in favor of the Norfolk Arena, where audiences saw Arthur “Buttons” Speakers, the first African American athlete at ODU, play. With the growth of the physical education department and popularity of the athletic teams, in addition to more students coming to campus, a new athletic facility was needed. Now known as Rollins Hall, the building currently includes administrative offices such as the Office of Finance, University Registrar, Financial Aid, and Office of Admissions. 

Although the first attempt to receive funds for a stadium in 1934 failed, the Norfolk Division, with the support of A.H. Foreman, successfully received municipal funds as well as funding from the WPA and the Virginia Emergency Relief Administration between 1935 and 1936. <span class="notation" data-id="1" data-zoom="18" data-lat="36.889019" data-lon="-76.304938">The site for the stadium was on the open field south of the old Larchmont School.</span> Construction began in 1935, and the stadium was dedicated on October 3, 1936 in honor of A.H. Foreman for all his efforts in securing the stadium for the school and the city.[^4]

Foreman Field was primarily used for the football team, but when the football team disbanded in 1941 due to the expense and lack of support from the community, more field sports took place there including field hockey, soccer, and track. Baseball, however, would continue to be played at the Larchmont Elementary School field until the Bud Metheny Baseball Complex opened in 1983. Football, however, was still played at Foreman Field from 1946 to 1995 in the form of the annual Oyster Bowl, sponsored by the Shriners and featured local high school and college teams. Foreman Field was also used for non-athletic events, such as the Greek Games, Commencements exercises, and concerts, the largest of which featured over 30,000 attendees for the Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young reunion tour in 1974. There were several attempts to revive football over the years, and some movements to take down the stadium altogether. President James L Bugg, Jr. mentioned in a 1998 interview that he “suggested we pull down the stadium. I got into trouble for that.”[^5] It wasn’t until 2009 that the first game in 69 years was played. By this time, all the other field sports found homes at other facilities across campus. The last game at Foreman Field occurred in 2018, and with the original structure torn down, the current S.B. Ballard Stadium took its place for the 2019 season.

In 1970, <span class="notation" data-id="1" data-zoom="18" data-lat="36.885935" data-lon="-76.311252">the Health and Physical Education (HP&E) Building</span> opened with classrooms for the Physical Education program, a recreation center for the students, and a new gymnasium, dubbed the “Fieldhouse,” where the basketball teams would compete. Built during ODU’s expansion boom in the 1960s and 1970s, the HP&E Building was located in the Lambert’s Point neighborhood between 46th and 48th Streets along Powhatan Avenue. 

{{< figure id="image5" image="HealthPhysicalEducationBuilding-EntranceCourtyard-1980s.jpg" caption="Figure 5. Health and Physical Education (HP&E) Building, circa 1980-1989." >}}

Both men’s and women’s basketball teams held their home games here from 1970 to 1977, when the men moved their home games to the larger Norfolk Scope arena, and then moved back to the HP&E Building on a part-time basis in 1990. The Fieldhouse saw the rise of prominence in ODU women’s basketball with national championships in 1979, 1980, and 1985 under coach Marianne Stanley, and witnessed greats such as Nancy Lieberman, Anne Donovan, Inge Nissen, Medina Dixon, and Ticha Penicheiro.

Over her 24 seasons as coach, Wendy Larry amassed a 559-203 record, won 17 straight Colonial Athletic Association titles, and reached 20 NCAA tournament appearances, including the championship game in 1997. Meanwhile, the men won the 1975 NCAA Division II championship, moved up to Division I, and upset Villanova in a triple overtime thriller in the 1995 NCAA tournament. Some of the stars during this time were Wilson Washington, Ronnie Valentine, Mark West, Dave Twardzik, Petey Sessoms, and Cal Bowdler. In addition to basketball, the Fieldhouse was home to special events and concerts for local and national bands such as Frank Zappa, Stephen Stills, and the Byrds.[^6] By the late 1990s, there was a need for a larger basketball court on campus, and a new convocation center with a new basketball arena was made part of the <span class="notation" data-id="1" data-zoom="17" data-lat="36.884111" data-lon="-76.301382">University Village</span> project, a 75 acre mixed use development of offices, student housing, shops, and restaurants across Hampton Boulevard from main campus in the Highland Gardens neighborhood. Completed in 2002, the Ted Constant Convocation Center includes Chartway Arena, home to the men’s and women’s basketball teams, and rooms for conferences and workshops. The HP&E Building, except for the swimming pool, was demolished in 2006 to make room for the new Student Recreation Center (SRC), which opened in 2008.
