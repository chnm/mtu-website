A shattered glass door. Insults such as "stooge," "commie," "hooligan," and "long-haired hippy bastard" (Broadside Dec 6, 1971). Punches thrown. This was the scene in a parking lot on the edge of campus at George Mason College on a Friday night in 1971. This scene was labeled the "Mallory House incident" by administrators at the University of Virginia, of which Mason was still a branch college at that time. The incident was essentially a fight between Jack Cassedy, a student and editor of the student newspaper, and James Conner, the Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds. There were conflicting reports about who caused and instigated the incident; Cassedy claimed that Conner threw the first punch while Conner swore it was Cassedy. But the consistent facts from every statement reported an altercation that started when a friend of Cassedy's parked in the lot without a permit, and this caused a verbal and physical conflict between Cassedy and Conner.

The events outside the Mallory House that evening reflect broader issues over student safety, campus spaces like parking lots and student newspaper offices, and the national moment in the 1970s of youth counterculture pitted against authoritative structures. This essay will explore these larger themes by detailing the Mallory House incident, university and community responses thereafter, and the larger issues of parking and safety on college campuses. It argues that in many ways, the built environment of college campuses, especially parking lots, can serve as a window into understanding broader issues on a national scale. 
On Friday December 3, 1971 at around 7 or 8pm, Dani Devere, a Northern Virginia College student, pulled up to the parking lot of the Mallory House to pick up her friend Jack Cassedy. Mallory House housed the offices of the Buildings and Grounds department, purchasing office, and the student newspaper Broadside, where Cassedy was a student editor. Shortly after, James Conner, Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds, and William Clark, a purchasing agent of GMC, arrived to pick up papers in Conner's office. They walked from Conner's house, which was a short distance away. Conner asked Devere why she did not have a parking permit. Clark stated that she replied "nast[ily]...none of your business," while Devere and Cassedy claimed that she was verbally harassed and smelt alcohol on his breath (Clark statement, 1971-12-08; Cassedy statement). Then, Cassedy met them outside and told Devere to call the police. A verbal then physical conflict ensued between Cassedy and Conner, though there were conflicting accounts over specifics. Clark claims that Cassedy said: "You two are stooges of the administration trying to close down the newspaper" and "made other incoherent remarks about abortions," while Cassedy claims that the two staff members insulted his long hair and called him a hippie, commie, and other derogatory names.

So far, the details about this event reflect larger trends of radical youth counterculture, issues of bodily autonomy, and regulation of campus parking lots that occured nationally in the United States in the 1970s. American youth counterculture was mostly seen in protests against the Vietnam War, participation in liberal movements such as the sex revolution, and questioning authority, especially on college campuses. The insults around Cassedy's long "hippy hair" and the accusation that GMC staff were "stooges" trying to shut down the Broadside both reflect broader conflict between radical youth and older authoritative college administrators in the early 1970s. Nineteen seventy-one was the same year that GMC faculty James Shear had caused controversy on campus over his protests against the Vietnam war. The American civil rights movement also still lingered in the national spotlight, as the Black Panther Movement was gaining broader attention. Conversations related to African American rights and educational institutions were also still happening in the U.S. In short, the 1970s were contentious times between older and younger people in the U.S.

The accusations during the Mallory House incident also reflect issues over bodily autonomy and sexuality relevant to the early 1970s American youth counterculture. Title IX of the Education Amendments was passed in 1972 that prohibited sex discrimination in any education program, which had implications for improving protocols for sexual assaults on college campuses. In 1973, the Supreme Court issued the federal right to abortion in the Roe v. Wade decision, granting women power over their own bodies beyond campus safety. Before abortion was legalized, the Broadside published multiple stories about abortion, from out of state abortion referrals to explicit statements of support. On November 10, 1971, the Dean of Students published a letter that these articles were in direct violation of the state of Virginia's Attorney General. The next week, Jack Cassedy in his  column "Pot Shots" argued "The instructors who changed their minds about supporting Broadside's Abortion stand will be missed." (Nov 15, 1971). This shows the significance of abortion on GMC's campus, which reflects the larger national conversation around women's rights to abortion. It is also another example of conflict between the student newspaper and university administration over student autonomy. 

However, a Broadside article about an at-home abortive medicine by Cassedy was later removed in December 1971, as the paper acknowledged that it was unfactual and medically harmful. The author implies that Cassedy's column "Pot Shot" was removed altogether because of this "medically sloppy" article. The author contends that Casssedy's reasons for the article were solely political with "littleâ€¦concern for the well being of woman-kind." This update was published Dec 13, 1971, and explicitly supports Cassedy in regard to the Mallory House incident, yet remains critical of Cassedy in light of the abortion article. This specific instance complicates Cassedy's abortion stance and also paints him as a more complex figure, demonstrating that Cassedy's activism was not always received well.

The events after the Mallory House incident strongly reflect university politics, especially the dynamics between parent institutions and their branch colleges. The Broadside published an article titled "Cassedy Assaulted '' three days after the incident on December 6th, which reported Cassedy's side of the story. Over the next few days, GMC collected statements from the witnesses of the event. Six days after the incident, Nehemiah Jordan, a representative of UVA President Shannon, pushed for GMC Chancellor Lorin Thompson to publicly respond to the incident. Jordan warned: "I can see a real juicy lawsuit on our hands." Clearly, UVA had influence over its branch college, because the next day, GMC Chancellor Thompson issued a statement that they were aware of the incident and collecting all the facts before making a decision.

Different testimonies and reports around the incident reveal campus issues over parking lots and broader concerns over student safety. It was an issue for Devere to not have a parking permit for a GMC parking lot because rules were in place to limit the parking to students, faculty, and staff only. In his initial statement after the Mallory House incident, Thompson said, "had [university parking] regulations been observed last Friday night, this unfortunate incident could probably have been prevented." Parking lots were often discussed as vulnerable areas for young women, amplifying different concerns of the feminist movement of the 1970s. Ironically, many students reportedly felt unsafe after the incident not because it was in the parking lot at night but rather because it was a conflict between a student and staff member. Student body president Jim Corrigan said on a phone call with a UVA representative,"To be quite frank, Mr. Conners' temper is well known and as well, people are scared, students are scared, people are upset." Corrigan used this fear to request that GMC Chancellor Thompson put Conner on leave. The General Faculty also recommended giving Conner administrative leave with pay before making any official resolution. By mid-February 1972, Thompson reported that the case was closed as there was no solid evidence to move forward on any allegations. So although the Mallory House incident remained largely unresolved, it illustrates how significant the issue over parking lots was and continues to be on college campuses.

Overall, the Mallory House incident shows that parking lots were gray areas on campus that witnessed different encounters and discord between people both a part of and outside of the college community. In many instances outside of GMC and the Mallory House lot, campus parking lots caused moments of tension where people defined who did and did not belong on campus. From the parking regulations and permit requirements to their locations on the edge of campus, parking lots often caused disagreement and encounters between different groups of people. In the case of the Mallory House, it was a space across the street from the border of campus where Buildings and Grounds staff parked alongside students who were politically active on campus and, at times, controversially anti-administration and anti-authority. As campus regulations became more enforced with tighter regulations around permits, the lot became a greater site of tension between staff and students, resulting in the Mallory House incident. This event opens a window into the complex figures of both Conner and Cassedy, as well as represents the larger struggles between students on campus and university administration and staff. The Mallory House incident shows why studying the built environment of college campuses is important and how the history of physical spaces can open up larger trends and issues around political and social movements of the time.
